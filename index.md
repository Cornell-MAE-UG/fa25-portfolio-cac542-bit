## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/headshot.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a second year in Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. As a member of the Cornell Cup Robotics Team, I've been exploring my passion for robotics and with through our partnership with Experiential Robotics, made real progress in improving access to robotics education. An avid historical researcher, I am also currently working on a project studying the structural history of the Brighton Beach Hotel in Brooklyn, work that has been recognized by the New York Public Library. In my free time, I enjoy participating in community theatre as I am a classically trained singer.
